### Phase 1: Excel Data Cleaning 
Raw climate and market data contained redundant metadata, structural mismatches, and multi-market duplicates. Excel was utilized to isolate Kano and Kaduna states, standardize pricing metrics, and establish clean monthly time-series baselines.

#### **Data Cleaning Steps Executed**
To prepare the raw market data, I used Excel to clean, filter, and organize the records using these 7 steps:

1. **Removed Unnecessary Columns:** Deleted columns that were not needed for the analysis to keep the file clean.
2. **Filtered by Location:** Filtered the data to focus only on **Kano** and **Kaduna** states.
3. **Isolated Commodity & Split Units:** Filtered for **White Maize** and separated the text and numbers in the unit column (e.g., turning "100kg" into `100` and `kg`) using this formula:
   ```excel
   =IF(L2="KG", 1, VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(L2, "KG", "")))
4. **Filtered out Retail:** Removed Retail records to focus only on Wholesale data (doing this before splitting the units would have made things more straightforward!).
5. **Split the Date:** Separated the full date column to keep only the Month and Year.
6. **Calculated Price Per KG:** Created a new column by dividing the total price by the parsed numerical unit.
7. **Aggregated with a Pivot Table:** Used a Pivot Table to average and unify the prices where different markets recorded different prices for the same state in the exact same month.
